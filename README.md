### Unfixed Bugs

1. Bad Array - No clue on how to select specific items by name.
  - Array only console.logs [object object] after changes. Not working.
  - Did changes to existing array to add name attribute.
2. Game card divs are not responding to clicks.
3. Got tired of the console error due to missing favicon. Added the one from Love Maths for now.
4. Cards won't change color of <i> when clicked
5. cards wont compare (Object to string) - Not working, adding data-id to cards so that these can be compared.
6. game board doubles number of cards when "play again" is pressed.
  Created function that clears game-board.
7. Cards are not re-shuffeling upon restart.
8. When game is won an endless loop is created.
9. If you double klick a card it sometimes seems to not turn back.
